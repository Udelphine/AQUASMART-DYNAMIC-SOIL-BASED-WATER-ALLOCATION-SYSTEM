Final Capstone Project Presentation

Student: Uwineza Delphine
ID: 27897
Course: Database Development with PL/SQL
Lecturer: Eric Maniraquha
Date: December 2025
AUCA - Adventist University of Central Africa

The Challenge:
• Traditional irrigation wastes 30-50% of water
• Fixed schedules ignore actual soil needs
• Manual monitoring is labor-intensive
• No data-driven decision making

Impact:
• Water scarcity in agricultural regions
• Reduced crop yields
• Increased operational costs
• Environmental strain

AquaSmart Solution:
• Real-time soil moisture monitoring
• Automated, precise irrigation control
• Data-driven decision making
• 40-60% water savings

Key Features:
1. Sensor-based monitoring
2. PL/SQL intelligent control
3. Automated valve activation
4. Comprehensive logging
5. Business intelligence

8-TABLE ARCHITECTURE:

Core Tables (4):
• FARM_ZONES - Irrigation areas
• SENSOR_DATA - Real-time readings  
• IRRIGATION_VALVES - Control system
• IRRIGATION_LOGS - Historical data

Phase VII Tables (4):
• EMPLOYEES - User management
• EMPLOYEE_SALARY - Sensitive data
• HOLIDAYS - Business rule dates
• AUDIT_LOG - Security tracking

AUTOMATED IRRIGATION WORKFLOW:

1. Sensor Reading → Database
2. PL/SQL Analysis → Water Deficit Calculation
3. Decision Making → Activate/Deactivate
4. Valve Control → Precise Watering
5. Logging → Audit Trail + Analytics

PL/SQL COMPONENTS:

Procedures (5):
• activate_irrigation()
• process_sensor_data()  
• generate_daily_report()
• manage_holidays()
• log_audit_entry()

Functions (4):
• calculate_water_deficit()
• is_operation_restricted()
• get_irrigation_efficiency()
• is_holiday_today()

Packages (3):
• AQUASMART_CONTROL_PKG
• AQUASMART_SECURITY_PKG  
• AQUASMART_AUDIT_PKG

CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE:

Restriction: Employees with 'S' usernames cannot:
• INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
• Perform operations on public holidays
• All attempts logged in AUDIT_LOG

Implementation:
1. HOLIDAYS table management
2. Compound trigger enforcement
3. Comprehensive audit logging
4. 10 test cases validation

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:

1. Water Efficiency Ratio: >90%
2. Irrigation Accuracy: >95%  
3. System Uptime: >99.5%
4. Water Savings: 40% reduction
5. Energy Consumption: <2.5 kWh/event

Dashboards:
• Executive Overview
• Operational Control
• Analytics & Reporting
• Audit & Security

VALIDATION RESULTS:

Data Volume:
• 8 tables created
• 100-500 rows per table
• Realistic test data

Testing:
• All PL/SQL components tested
• Phase VII restrictions validated
• Audit logging verified
• Performance optimized

ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Complete PL/SQL database solution
2. Phase VII business rule implemented
3. Comprehensive audit system
4. Business intelligence ready
5. Production-ready code quality

LESSONS LEARNED:
• Requirements-driven design
• Thorough testing is essential
• Documentation saves time
• Oracle PL/SQL is powerful

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
• Mobile application
• Weather API integration
• Machine learning predictions
• IoT sensor expansion
